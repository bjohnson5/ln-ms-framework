# Demo
The two demo videos here show the difference in memory usage between docker and the simulation framework. 
- The `polar.mp4` video shows 15 LND docker containers being started, each of them using about 40 MB of memory
- The `ln_ms_server.mp4` video shows 100 simulation nodes being started, with a total of 35 MB of memory being used

Each of the simulation nodes in the network graph that is shown is backed by a Sensei node and is completely capable of accepting peer connections, opening/closing channels, and making payments.
